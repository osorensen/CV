  abstract = {The question of how much sleep is best for the brain attracts scientific and public interest, and there is concern that insuficient sleep leads to poorer brain health. However, it is unknown how much sleep is sufficient and how much is too much. We analyzed 51,295 brain magnetic resonnance images from 47,039 participants, and calculated the self-reported sleep duration associated with the largest regional volumes and smallest ventricles relative to intracranial volume (ICV) and thickest cortex. 6.8 hours of sleep was associated with the most favorable brain outcome overall. Critical values, defined by 95\% confidence intervals, were 5.7 and 7.9 hours. There was regional variation, with for instance the hippocampus showing largest volume at 6.3 hours. Moderately long sleep ({$>$} 8 hours) was more strongly associated with smaller relative volumes, thinner cortex and larger ventricles than even very short sleep ({$<$} 5 hours), but effect sizes were modest. People with larger ICV reported longer sleep (7.5 hours), so not correcting for ICV yielded longer durations associated with maximal volume. Controlling for socioeconomic status, body mass index and depression symptoms did not alter the associations. Genetic analyses showed that genes related to longer sleep in short sleepers were related to shorter sleep in long sleepers. This may indicate a genetically controlled homeostatic regulation of sleep duration. Mendelian randomization analyses did not suggest sleep duration to have a causal impact on brain structure in the analyzed datasets. The findings challenge the notion that habitual short sleep is negatively related to brain structure. Significance statement According to consensus recommendations, adults should sleep between 7 and 9 hours to optimize their health. We found that sleeping less than the recommended amount was associated with greater regional brain volumes relative to intracranial volume, and very short sleep was only weakly related to smaller volumes. Genetic analyses did not show causal effects of sleep duration on brain structure. Taken together, the results suggest that habitual short sleep is not an important contributor to lower brain volumes in adults on a group level, and that large individual dfferences in sleep need likely exist.},

  abstract = {The discrepancy between chronological age and the apparent age of the brain based on neuroimaging data \textemdash{} the brain age delta \textemdash{} has emerged as a reliable marker of brain health. With an increasing wealth of data, approaches to tackle heterogeneity in data acquisition are vital. To this end, we compiled raw structural magnetic resonance images into one of the largest and most diverse datasets assembled (n=53542), and trained convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to predict age. We achieved state-of-the-art performance on unseen data from unknown scanners (n=2553), and showed that higher brain age delta is associated with diabetes, alcohol intake and smoking. Using transfer learning, the intermediate representations learned by our model complemented and partly outperformed brain age delta in predicting common brain disorders. Our work shows we can achieve generalizable and biologically plausible brain age predictions using CNNs trained on heterogeneous datasets, and transfer them to clinical use cases.},

A profile likelihood algorithm is proposed, and we derive asymptotic standard errors of both smooth and parametric terms. The work was motivated by applications in cognitive neuroscience, and we show how GALAMMs can successfully model the complex lifespan trajectory of latent episodic memory, along with a discrepant trajectory of working memory, as well as the effect of latent socioeconomic status on hippocampal development. Simulation experiments suggest that model estimates are accurate even with moderate sample sizes.},

  abstract = {Higher general cognitive ability (GCA) is associated with lower risk of neurodegenerative disorders, but neural mechanisms are unknown. GCA could be associated with more cortical tissue, from young age, i.e. brain reserve, or less cortical atrophy in adulthood, i.e. brain maintenance. Controlling for education, we investigated the relative association of GCA with reserve and maintenance of cortical volume, -area and -thickness through the adult lifespan, using multiple longitudinal brain imaging cohorts (n = 3327, 7002 MRI scans, baseline age 20-88 years, followed-up up to 11 years). There were widespread positive relationships between GCA and cortical characteristics (level-level associations). In select regions, higher baseline GCA was associated with less atrophy over time (level-change associations). Relationships remained when controlling for polygenic scores for both GCA and education. Our findings suggest that higher GCA is associated with cortical volumes by both brain reserve and -maintenance mechanisms through the adult lifespan.},
